        <p class="text-red-600">TODO: Insert image of Swansea uni here</p>

        <p>
          I've been interested in software development from a young age starting
          in high school. There I got my GCSE and A-Level in computing achieving
          an "A" in both. From there I went to Swansea university to continue my
          study in Computer Science leaving with a Upper Second-Class Honours
          (2:1).
        </p>

        <p class="text-red-600">TODO: Insert image of me developing GAIN</p>

        <p>
          While at university I started a company with my housemate Tom called
          GAIN.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a social discount platform where I built both the website using
          Laravel
          <Icon name="logos:laravel" class="h-4 inline" />
           and mobile app using Flutter
          <Icon name="logos:flutter" class="h-4 inline" /> and then published
          them to the Google Play <Icon
            name="logos:google-play-icon"
            class="h-4 inline"
          /> and IOS App Store <Icon
            name="logos:apple-app-store"
            class="h-4 inline"
          />.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p class="text-red-600">TODO: Insert image of IQUW</p>

        <p>
          After university I've been working in Java <Icon
            name="logos:java"
            class="h-4 inline"
          /> at IQUW as part of the bespoke development team. There I have
          expanded my DevOps knowledge in CI/CD as well as how to deliver
          production level application as part of a business.

          TODO: Insert image of my 3D printer and prints
        </p>
        <p>
          Nearing the end of university I was looking into 3D printing and I was
          lucky to receive a new Ender 3 from my friend all clubing together for
          my birthday. Since then I have dived in designing my own 3D models
          using Fusion 360 as well as installing Klipper and some add-ons to the
          printer itself.
