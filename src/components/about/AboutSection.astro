        <p>
          I've been interested in software development from a young age starting
          in high school. I build some mods for Minecraft and small websites
          while going through school and left with an "A" in both my GCSE and
          A-Level in computing.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          I then decided to continue my studies at Swansea university doing
          Computer Science. There I learnt how to design software with a team <span
            class="text-red-600">...</span
          > leaving with a Upper Second-Class Honours (2:1).
        </p>
        <br />

          src={"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Swansea_University_Bay_Library_and_students.jpg"}
          alt={"Swansea university Bay library"}
        />
        <p>
          While I was there I started a company with my housemate Tom Robertson,
          together we created GAIN. It was a social discount platform that
          focused on independents stores, cafes and restaurants in a bid to help
          bring people back to the high street and support their local business.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p class="text-red-600">TODO: Insert image of me developing GAIN</p>

        <p>
          While work on the business I built the website and backend API using
          Laravel
          <Icon name="logos:laravel" class="h-4 inline" />
           and an accompanying mobile app using Flutter
          <Icon name="logos:flutter" class="h-4 inline" /> and then published it
          to the Google Play <Icon
            name="logos:google-play-icon"
            class="h-4 inline"
          /> and IOS App Store <Icon
            name="logos:apple-app-store"
            class="h-4 inline"
          />. We went on to <i>gain</i> a few thousand users, around 50 stores
          all in and around Swansea with it growing every month. We were also in
          talks with Swansea's Liberty Stadium in how the app can be expanded to
          be used in the stadium for customers to order from the app and speed
          up the bars at half time.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          This success didn't last unfortunately as COVID forced us to stop
          signing up new stores as well it being based on in-store redemptions
          we were hit very hard. After lockdown we both no longer lived in
          Swansea as well as near each other so decided to close up shop and
          focus on new graduate jobs and building up our careers.
        </p>

        <p>
          After university, I've have been working at IQUW with Java <Icon
            name="logos:java"
            class="h-4 inline"
          /> as part of the bespoke development team. There I have expanded my
          DevOps knowledge in CI/CD and how to deliver production-level
          applications as part of a business.

        <p>
          Nearing the end of university I was looking into 3D printing and I was
          lucky to receive a new Ender 3 from my friend all clubbing together
          for my birthday. Since then I have dived in designing my own 3D models
          using Fusion 360 as well as installing Klipper and some add-ons to the
          printer itself.
